# Denoising-Medical-Images

## Problem Statement

Due to advancement in technology we might have a large amount of the data but there is always concern about the usability .For example in images like X-rays , MRI, CT scans, Ultrasound, etc., when original images are put in the paper the quality degrades, due to which the accuracy of the decision model degrades.These images are susceptible to noise.

Therefore **Image denoising** is used to suppress noise from noise-contaminated images , is required for image analysis and  an important preprocessing step in image analysis.Also many algorithms have been proposed with different performance rates but deep learning convolutional method has outperformed all methods .
